This solution is a compilation of NUnitLite targeting Mono for Android. 

At present, there is no runner - If you include this library in an android application, the tests can be run on an emulator. I have included an example test application.

I included a boolean return from the test fixture run, so that the calling application can determine if the all the tests passed or not.

The downloads section has a couple of images for examples of test fixture executions. The test application simply changes the colour of the text based on the boolean return from the run.

The original NUnitLite readme is in NUnitLite.README.txt. Despite the text there, the version of NUnitLite used is 0.6.
